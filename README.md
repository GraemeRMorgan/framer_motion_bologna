# Playground
This is just a simple code playground that I use to make projects. 

## Getting Started

First, install the packages.

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
bun install
```
Then, run the project locally.
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
